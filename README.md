# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This is a tool which helps in analysing the sentiment of tweets made by users on Twitter by using NLP(natural language processing) and fetches the real-time data using Tweepy and Twitter developer accounts. The library I used for the sentiment analysis is VADER( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) which is an NLTK module that provides sentiment scores based on the words used.
